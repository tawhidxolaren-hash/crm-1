I want to build a simple crm app for entering leads, tracking leads, follow-ups, reminder for follow-ups.


It will have several input forms for customer creation, project creation, project type creation, employee creation.

For each new lead creation, there will be following inputs to give:

Project Category (drop down list: EPC, ISS, PSE, SPP)
Assigned Sales Person (drop down list from employee list: Shahin, Anjuman, Rifah, Sabbir, Shihab)	
Offer created (date)
Lead Through (drop down list from employee list: Shahin, Anjuman, Rifah, Sabbir, Shihab)	
Customer Name (drop down list of all customers. there will be a new customer entry and customer information edit option)
Socpe of wrok (text box)	
Status (drop down list: Connected, Technical Analysis, Price Offered, Won, Completed, Lost)	
Initial Offer Number: (it will start from 1 and counting)
Offer Revision Number: it will start from R1 and counting as R2, R3, ... under each Initial Offer Number of the same Customer and same Project Category 
Offered value at this offer revision:  (BDT)	
Priority (drop down list: P-1, P-2, P-3, P-4)
Follow-up by (drop down list from employee list: Shahin, Anjuman, Rifah, Sabbir, Shihab)		
Follow up status (text box)	
Follow Up Date (date)		
Next Follow up date (date)
Serial number (this will be generated by a custom function rule, once Status value is set to "Price Offered")


The function to generate a Serial number will be: XBL/<Project Category>/<Customer Name>/<date>/<Initial Offer number>/<Offer Revision Number>


No need to have user authentication at this stage.
